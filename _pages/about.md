I am now a postdoctoral researcher affliated to Department of Mathematical Informatics,
Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.ibis.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/yamanishi/index_e.html">Kenji Yamanishi</a>. 
I obtained my Ph. D, degree in Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/">Jiannong Cao</a>, in 2018. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2013. From 2015 to 2016, I visited <a href="http://bdsc.lab.uic.edu">BDSC lab</a> led by Professor <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/PSYu/">Philip S. Yu</a> in University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.

 My research interests include application of deep learning on glaucoma propression prediction, network change detection based on network embedding, and generally data mining and machine learning.
